# Plugin Templates

The plugin-templates folder should contain subfolder that should be copied to the plugin folder after it is scaffolded. Search and replace will be run on the files after they are copied over.

Currently the subfolders are
* blocks
* config
* entries
* features

Use the following placeholders in your files, and they will automatically get updated to the correct values to match the destination plugin.

* `create-wordpress-plugin`
* `Create WordPress Plugin`
* `CREATE_WORDPRESS_PLUGIN`
* `create_wordpress_plugin`
* `Create_WordPress_Plugin`
