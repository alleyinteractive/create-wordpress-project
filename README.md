# Create WordPress Project

This is a skeleton WordPress project that can be used to quickly scaffold
WordPress projects that work with Alley's
[create-wordpress-plugin](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/create-wordpress-plugin)
and
[create-wordpress-theme](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/create-wordpress-theme)
starter kits.

This template is rooted at the `wp-content` and supports both Pantheon and
WordPress VIP hosting environments with deployment workflows for each. It is
powered by [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage dependencies and
[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) to build front-end assets in your project. The template includes both GitHub Actions and Buddy workflows for continuous integration and deployment.

Also included is a configuration script to easily replace all placeholders throughout the project and scaffold out your plugin/theme.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Press the "Use template" button at the top of this repo to create a new repo
   with the contents of this skeleton.
2. Run `make` (or `php ./configure.php`) to run the configuration script that
   will replace all placeholders throughout all the files.
3. Have fun creating your WordPress site! ðŸŽŠ
